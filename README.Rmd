The case study presented here is the final capstone project of the [**Google Data Analytics**](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) certification program.<br> I've undertaken the entire project using **R** (perhaps a bit masochistic), but it's all part of the fun.

The journey took a bit longer than anticipated, as life had its own plans; specifically, my first child decided to join the party mid-analysis! <br> Therefore, this work is **dedicated to my newborn**, who brought an extra dose of joy to the process üöÄ

This case study is also available on **Kaggle** at the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lcolon/cyclistic-2023-google-da-capstone-project-r)

-   The company categorizes users into 2 main groups:
    -   **"Casual"** users , who buy single-rides or full-day passes
    -   **"Member"** users, who purchase annual memberships

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 25px 0;">

-   Cyclistic believes that **members are more profitable** than casual riders and aims at designing marketing strategies to **convert casual riders into annual members**

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 25px 0;">

-   In order to accomplish this, the company seeks the answer to the following question, which will also serve as the **objective of the analysis**:
