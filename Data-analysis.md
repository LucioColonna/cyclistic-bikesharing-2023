## 1. Overview of 2023

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

The first step in our analysis is to gather useful data for the entire
year of 2023. Specifically, I will retrieve data for both members and
casual users, focusing on:

- Total number of rides
- Average ride duration
- Average distance travelled

For the average distance travelled, I will exclude round trips, as their
distance is 0 and could compromise the results: 

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_02.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> - **Members** account for a larger proportion of total rides (**65%**)
>   compared to casual users (**35%**). This is a positive sign for the
>   company, as members are considered more profitable
> - **Members** prefer **shorter, more frequent rides** (which is
>   typical for a subscription-based model), while **casual** users tend
>   to have **longer ride durations**
> - **Casual** users show **longer trip durations** and **slightly
>   greater distances**. This could be due to casual users being more
>   likely to use the bikes for leisurely activities, while members
>   might use them for quick, practical commutes

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

### 1.1 Total minutes spent cycling

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_03.png" width="50%">
</p>

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> - Despite members having more rides (as shown in the previous data),
>   casual users collectively spent more time on bikes. This indicates
>   that **casual** users tend to take **longer trips** compared to
>   members
> - **Members**, while having a lower total time spent compared to
>   casual users, may be using the service **more efficiently** for
>   **shorter** and **more frequent trips**, likely for **commuting**
>   purposes

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

### 1.2 Round trips

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_04.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> - **Casual** users make a larger proportion of their rides as **round
>   trips** (**8%**) compared to **members** (**3%**). This might
>   suggest that casual users are more likely to use the service for
>   leisure or sightseeing, where they return to their starting point
> - The **average duration** of round trips for **casual** users is
>   **significantly longer** (**44.24 minutes**) than for **members**
>   (**23.31 minutes**). This aligns with the intuition that casual
>   users generally take longer trips
> - **Members** tend to have **shorter round trips**, which might
>   indicate that their usage is more **practical** and
>   **time-efficient**, possibly for commuting or running quick errands

<br>

## 2. By Ride Duration

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

<!-- In order to deeply analyze the ride duration of trips, I will first calculate the **quartiles** of the duration in minutes for all data and then separately for both members and casual users: -->

    ## Quartiles of duration_minutes (ALL DATA):

    ##   Q    %   Value
    ##  Q0   0%    1.00
    ##  Q1  25%    5.83
    ##  Q2  50%   10.00
    ##  Q3  75%   17.73
    ##  Q4 100% 1439.87

    ## Quartiles of duration_minutes (CASUAL):

    ##   Q    %   Value
    ##  Q0   0%    1.00
    ##  Q1  25%    7.42
    ##  Q2  50%   13.00
    ##  Q3  75%   24.43
    ##  Q4 100% 1437.68

    ## Quartiles of duration_minutes (MEMBER):

    ##   Q    %   Value
    ##  Q0   0%    1.00
    ##  Q1  25%    5.25
    ##  Q2  50%    8.78
    ##  Q3  75%   14.90
    ##  Q4 100% 1439.87

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> - 50% of all rides lasted **10 minutes or less**
> - The **median** duration for **casual users (13.00 minutes)** is
>   notably **higher** than that of **members (8.78 minutes)**
> - The trip **durations** for casual users are more **spread out**,
>   with the **Q3 at 24.43 minutes**, compared to **14.90 minutes** for
>   **members**
> - The **maximum trip durations are similar** across both casual and
>   members, indicating that there are some very long trips taken by
>   both, but they do not significantly impact the overall distribution
>
> Overall, the data above reaffirms the previous observations:
> **casual** users tend to have **longer trip durations** while
> **members** have **shorter, more frequent trips**.

<!-- I now want to analyze more in depth the duration of trips. To do so, I intend to divide the data into manageable intervals, hoping I can gain insights into how rides are distributed. -->

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

### 2.1 All trips

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

I will start dividing the data into **1-hour intervals**.

<!-- To achieve this, I'm utilizing the ```cut``` function, through which I'll partition the data into intervals in the format of $(n, n+1]$ hours: -->

<br>

<!-- Next, I'll generate a density plot illustrating the duration of rides (I will apply a filter on ```duration_minutes``` to improve readibility): -->

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_05.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> - Rides lasting up to 60 minutes constitute the vast majority,
>   comprising ~97.25% of all rides (more than 4 mil. recorded
>   instances)
> - As the **duration increases**, the number of rides **decreases
>   significantly**: only 2.75% of rides lasted more than 1 hour
> - Overall, the data shows a **skewed distribution**, with the majority
>   of rides being relatively short in duration, while longer rides are
>   less frequent

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

### 2.2 Up to 60 minutes

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

Now let‚Äôs ‚Äúzoom in‚Äù on the rides that lasted between 1 and 60 minutes,
that constiute **~97% of all rides**.

<!-- I am going to use the same approach as before, but this time I am slicing the data in intervals of $[n, n+1)$ minutes, considering that 1 is the minimum duration: -->

<br>

<!-- Now, let's plot a bar chart to visualize the duration from 1 to 60 minutes according to the intervals defined above, **overlaying** the observations of members and casual riders: -->

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_06.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> **Casual**:
>
> - 1 to 7 minutes: there is a **progressive increase** in the number of
>   rides
> - 6 to 7 minutes: **peak usage** with **79,910** rides that account
>   for **5.40%** of the total casual rides
> - 7 minutes onward: the rides count begins to drop with the percentage
>   of total rides decreasing consistently in each interval
>
> **Members**:
>
> - 1 to 5 minutes: There is a consistent increase in the number of
>   rides.
> - 5 to 6 minutes: **peak usage** with **219,381** rides that account
>   for **8.16%** of the total member rides
> - 6 minutes onward: as for casual, a continuous decline in ride count
>   is observed, with percentages decreasing gradually
> - For members specifically, it is important to highlight that
>   according to the [**company‚Äôs pricing
>   policy**](https://divvybikes.com/pricing), the **first 45 minutes
>   are free**, after which a **per-minute fee is applied**. This
>   reinforces the concept that there is a decline in the number of
>   rides as the duration increases
>
> **Overall**:
>
> - Casual users and members both exhibit peak usage at different points
>   within their respective durations. Casual users peak slightly later,
>   between **6 to 7 minutes**, while members peak earlier, between **4
>   to 5 minutes**
> - After their respective peaks, both groups show a **steady decline**
>   in the number of rides, indicating **shorter trips are more
>   common**, and as **trip duration increases**, the **frequency of
>   such trips decreases**

<br>

<!-- Before moving on to the next section, I will remove the columns that were temporarily added for the analysis: -->

<br>

<div style="border-bottom: 3px solid #1ABDFF; color: #1ABDFF;">

</div>

<br>

## 3. By Distance

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

To analyze the distance, I will use the same methodology applied in the
previous section. However, there are two important points to keep in
mind:

- The calculated distances are **approximate** and represent the
  **straight-line distance** between the start and end stations. This is
  because the dataset does not include information about the actual
  distance covered via GPS
- **Round trips** have a **distance equal to 0** (since the start
  station is the same as the end station) and therefore have been
  **filtered out** in this analysis to avoid compromising the results

<!-- -->

    ## Quartiles of trip_distance_km (ALL DATA):

    ##   Q    %        Value
    ##  Q0   0%  0.001097435
    ##  Q1  25%  0.992675068
    ##  Q2  50%  1.620618606
    ##  Q3  75%  2.800075894
    ##  Q4 100% 33.046086828

    ## Quartiles of trip_distance_km (CASUAL):

    ##   Q    %        Value
    ##  Q0   0%  0.004716732
    ##  Q1  25%  1.105682750
    ##  Q2  50%  1.750670512
    ##  Q3  75%  2.898277487
    ##  Q4 100% 33.046086828

    ## Quartiles of trip_distance_km (MEMBER):

    ##   Q    %        Value
    ##  Q0   0%  0.001097435
    ##  Q1  25%  0.930068793
    ##  Q2  50%  1.545681154
    ##  Q3  75%  2.731385298
    ##  Q4 100% 25.595266290

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> - The overall quartiles indicate that **most trips are relatively
>   short**, with the median trip distance being around 1.6 km.
>   **Casual** users tend to have **slightly longer trip distances**
>   compared to members
> - The median (Q2) and 75th percentile (Q3) values for casual users are
>   also higher, indicating a tendency for casual users to engage in
>   longer trips
> - In short, **casual** users typically take **longer trips** than
>   members. This aligns with the observation that casual users often
>   use the service for leisure or recreational purposes, while members
>   might use it more for commuting and shorter, frequent trips

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

### 3.1 All trips

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

This time I will divide the data into **1-km intervals**.

<!-- To achieve this, I'm utilizing the ```cut``` function, through which I'll partition the data into intervals in the format of $(n,n+1]$ km: -->
<!-- Now I'll generate a density plot illustrating the distance in km of rides (I will apply a filter on ```trip_distance_km``` to improve readibility): -->

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_07.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> - The majority of trips are short, with **60.37% of trips** being
>   **under 2 km**
> - **As the distance increases**, the **frequency of trips decreases**.
>   For example, trips between 2 to 3 km account for ~17.4%, and trips
>   between 3 to 4 km make up ~9.0%. This trend continues with smaller
>   percentages for longer distances
> - There is a **long tail** in the distribution indicating that while
>   most trips are short, there are some longer trips. The **percentage
>   of trips** continues to **decrease for distances beyond 5 km**
> - In short, the data indicates that the **bike-sharing** service is
>   predominantly used for **short-distance trips**, with a significant
>   drop-off in the number of longer trips. This pattern is **typical
>   for urban bike-sharing schemes** where users prefer bikes for short
>   commutes or quick errands

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

### 3.2 Up to 10 km

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

Similarly to what done before, let‚Äôs now focus on the distances **lower
than 10 km**, that constitute ~99% of all rides (round trips not
included): <br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_08.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> - **Both casual and members** have the **highest number of trips** in
>   the **1 to 2 km** range.
> - **Members** show a **steeper decline** in trip counts after the 1 to
>   2 km range, suggesting a stronger **preference for short trips**
> - The counts for trips **beyond 2 km** decrease significantly for both
>   groups

<br>

<!-- Again, before moving on to the next section, I will remove the column that were temporarily added for the analysis: -->

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

### 3.3 VS ride duration

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_09.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> - **Both user groups** predominantly take **short trips** in terms of
>   **distance and duration**, as indicated by the clustering of the
>   majority of trips in the lower left quadrant of the plot

>   distances compared to members. This suggests that casual users are
>   more likely to take both very short and very long trips
> - **Members** tend to have **more consistent trip patterns** with
>   shorter durations and distances

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

## 4. By Quarter

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

<!-- Let's break down the ride count by quarter and member groups: -->

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_10.png" width="60%">

<br>

> Key findings:

> - The **first** and **fourth** quarters have the **lowest ride
>   counts** for both groups, likely due to less favorable **weather
>   conditions**
> - The **gap** between members and casual users fluctuates over time,
>   being **widest in the first quarter**

<br>

<div style="border-bottom: 3px solid #1ABDFF; color: #1ABDFF;">

<br>

## 5. By Month

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

<!-- Let's break down the ride count by month and member groups: -->

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_11.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> - both user groups show a clear **seasonal pattern**, with trip
>   numbers increasing in the **warmer months (April to September)** and
>   decreasing in the **colder months (October to March)**
> - the **peak month** for members is August while for casual users it
>   is July
> - the lowest trip counts occur in the **winter months** (January,
>   February, December), reflecting reduced activity likely due to less
>   favorable weather conditions

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

### 5.1 VS weather conditions

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

<!-- Previosuly we've hypothesized that there might be a seasonal trend in bike-sharing likely influenced by **weather conditions**. Now, let's see if we can provide a "scientific" basis for this assumption. 
&#10;To do this, I intend to correlate the monthly ride data with the **monthly average temperatures** and the **monthly average precipitations** recorded in Chicago in 2023. -->
<!-- Starting from the source dataframes, I am first converting "Farenheit" to "Celsius" (for temperature) and "inches" to "cm" (for precipitations). Then, I will merge them with the ```df_summary_month``` by using the ```left_join``` function: -->

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_12.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

Let‚Äôs see if the variables are correlated:

    ## $casual
    ## $casual$temp_correlation
    ## [1] 0.994
    ## 
    ## $casual$prcp_correlation
    ## [1] 0.128
    ## 
    ## 
    ## $member
    ## $member$temp_correlation
    ## [1] 0.984
    ## 
    ## $member$prcp_correlation
    ## [1] 0.001

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> Correlation with **avg. temperatures**:
>
> - The coefficients of **0.994** and **0.984** for respectively
>   **casual** and **member** riders suggests a **very strong positive
>   correlation** between the average temperature and the number of
>   rides per month
> - This indicates that **as the temperature increases**, there is a
>   significant **increase in the number of bike rides taken**. It
>   aligns with the intuitive understanding that warmer weather tends to
>   encourage outdoor activities like biking
>
> Correlation with **avg. precipitations**:
>
> - The coefficients of **0.127** and **0.001** for respectively
>   **casual** and **member** riders indicates that **precipitations**
>   have a **minimal influence** on the number of rides taken
> - For members specifically, the correlation is essentially zero,
>   implying that precipitation has virtually **no impact** on their
>   ride count

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

### 5.2 VS ride duration

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

<!-- Let's now explore the average ride duration by month for both groups: -->

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_13.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

> Key findings::
>
> - Both casual users and members show **increased average ride
>   durations** during the warmer months (April to September) due to (we
>   can definitely say it now üòÉ) more favorable weather conditions for
>   biking
> - **Members** show a more **consistent average ride duration** across
>   all months, suggesting a pattern of regular and shorter trips,
>   likely for commuting or routine errands

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<!-- Let's now plot a combo chart using function ```plot_rides_vs_duration``` and see if there is a correlation between the variables monthly ride count and monthyl avg. duration. -->
<!-- Please note that I am going to perform this same type of analysis later on as well with other time variables (day of the week, hour of the day) -->

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_14.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

Let‚Äôs find out if there is a correlation between number of rides and
average duration of trips for both groups:

<br>

    ## $casual
    ## [1] 0.947
    ## 
    ## $member
    ## [1] 0.958

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> - These results indicate a **strong positive correlation** between
>   **monthly ride counts** and average **ride duration** for both user
>   groups
> - It suggests that as the **number of rides per month increases**, so
>   does the **average duration** of those rides for both casual users
>   and members

## 8. Heatmaps

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

<!-- I reckon it would be useful to have a look at ride trends using heatmaps, as they are really effective at conveying information and visually revealing patterns in ride activity over time: -->

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_22.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> - **Months VS Days of the week**: as discussed in previous section,
>   casual tend to use bike-sharing services more frequently on
>   weekends, possibly for leisure activities and usage is increased
>   during warmer months. On the other hand, members show a more uniform
>   distribution across the week, suggesting they might be using the
>   service for daily commuting
>
> - **Day of the Week VS Hour of Day**: For member users, the commute
>   peaks highlighted in the previous section primarily occur on
>   weekdays (Monday to Friday), likely because most users use the bikes
>   for commuting to and from work during those days. Casual users
>   exhibit higher ride counts in the afternoon and early evening,
>   particularly on weekends
>
> - **Months VS Hour by Day**: When we combine months and hours, we see
>   that for members, the morning and evening peaks are consistent
>   throughout the year, slightly decreasing during the colder months.
>   For casual users, ride counts are relatively stable throughout the
>   day across all months, with a slight increase in the afternoon hours
>   during the summer months. The usage does not show significant peaks,
>   suggesting more sporadic and leisure-oriented usage
>
> - In summary, these heatmaps reaffirm the assumption that **members**
>   are mostly using the bike-sharing service for **commuting**, with
>   **consistent usage patterns** throughout the week and **peak usage**
>   during typical **commuting hours**. **Casual** users, on the other
>   hand, seem to use the service more for **leisure or errands**, with
>   increased usage during **weekends**

## 10. By Station

<br>

<!-- Now I want to analyze in detail the stations used for the bike sharing service.
&#10;First, I am creating a dataframe  ```merged_stations_all``` that combines both start and end stations, and provides information on type (start or end) and ride count for each user group. This DF will serve as the starting point for further analysis: -->

<br>

### 10.1 Geographical distribution and usage

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

I intend to analyze the **geographical distribution and usage of start
stations** for the year 2023, regardless of whether the rides pertain to
casual or member users.

<!-- To achieve this, I will create a new data frame named ```merged_stations_start```, by filtering the existing ```merged_stations_all``` to include only rows representing starting stations: -->

The aim is to represent the stations on a map using the
[**leaflet**](https://ugoproto.github.io/ugo_r_doc/pdf/leaflet-cheat-sheet.pdf)
library. To ensure that the representation makes sense, I first need to
identify some count bins.

I start by calculating the quartiles for the ‚Äúcount‚Äù column in the
dataset. This will help me understand the distribution of the counts:

``` r
quartiles_df <- calculate_quartiles(merged_stations_start, value_col = "count")
quartiles_df
```

    ##    Q    % Value
    ## 1 Q0   0%     1
    ## 2 Q1  25%    10
    ## 3 Q2  50%    97
    ## 4 Q3  75%  2931
    ## 5 Q4 100% 58222

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

Then I will define **breakpoints** to use as **thresholds** for
representing ride counts on a map.

The breaks are defined as the second quartile (Q2), the third quartile
(Q3), and the upper edge, which is calculated as Q3 plus 1.5 times the
IQR. This last breakpoint in particular will help to identify
exceptionally high ride counts.

Finally I create a vector `breaks` with these values:

``` r
# Inter Quartile Range = Q3 - Q1
IQR <- quartiles_df[4, 3] - quartiles_df[2, 3]

# Upper edge = (Q3 + IQR * 1.5)
upper_edge <- quartiles_df[4, 3] + IQR * 1.5

# breaks: Q2 | Q3 | (Q3 + IQR * 1.5) | [1]| [2]| [3] |

breaks <- round(unname(c(quartiles_df[3, 3], quartiles_df[4,
    3], upper_edge)))

breaks
```

>
> **Moderate to High-Density Areas (üü¢):**
>
> - The areas with significant ride counts extend from the downtown core
>   to nearby neighborhoods such as **Lincoln Park**, **Lakeview**, and
>   **South Loop**. These neighborhoods are primarly residential with

>   such as **Irvin Park**, **Logan Square**, **Evanston**, and **Albany
>   Park**. The ride counts in these areas are lower compared to the
>   central areas but still reflect moderate usage of ride services
>
> **Low-Density Areas (üîµ):**

> - The blue areas, representing the lowest ride counts, are primarily
>   found in the **outskirts** and **suburban regions** such as
>   **Norridge**, **Summit**, and other far-reaching suburbs. These
>   areas have less frequent ride activity, likely due to the **lower

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_27.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>


> Key findings:
>
> Casual Riders:
>
> - Both start and end stations for casual riders are highly
>   concentrated around **major tourist attractions** and **recreational
>   areas** such as **Streeter Dr & Grand Ave**, **DuSable Lake Shore
>   Dr**, **Michigan Ave**, and **Millennium Park**
> - This indicates that casual riders are likely **tourists** or
>   **occasional users** who utilize bike services to visit popular
>   sites in the city
>
> Member Riders:
>
> - For member riders, the start and end stations are more **dispersed**
>   and include locations like **Kingsbury St & Kinzie St**, **Clinton
>   St & Washington Blvd**, and **Clark St & Elm St.**
> - This pattern suggests that member riders, who are likely residents
>   or regular users, use bike services more for **commuting and daily
>   activities** rather than just for recreational purposes

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

Now let‚Äôs focus on the **top 20 start stations** and see them
represented on a map to better understand their **geographical
distribution** and **usage patterns** by casual users and members.<br>
Before that I want to make sure that each station is **ranked from 1 to
20** for each user group, so I can represent that information on the
map:

>
> Members:
>
> - In contrast, the top start stations for members are **spread more

>   intersections and transportation hubs**. Key stations include
>   Kingsbury St & Kinzie St, Clinton St & Washington Blvd, and Clark St
>   & Elm St
> - This distribution implies that members, **likely locals or frequent

<br>

### 10.4 User predominance

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

In this section, I aim to identify start stations that are
**predominantly used** by either **casual** users or **members**,
**beyond a certain threshold** of rides count.

<!-- In this code, I am setting three parameters: ```high_edge```, ```low_edge```, and ```station_materiality_threshold```:
 - The edges (```high_edge``` and ```low_edge```) define the degree of "predominance" of usage by the member groups (casual or member)
 - The ```station_materiality_threshold``` ensures that only stations with a minimum count of trips are considered
 &#10;I group the data by station name and coordinates, then summarize the total trip counts and the counts for casual and member users. 
Next, I filter out stations with fewer trips than the ```station_materiality_threshold``` and calculate the percentage of trips made by casual and member users. 
Using ```high_edge``` and ```low_edge```, I filter stations to identify those where one group significantly predominates. Finally, I label these stations based on the predominant user group and sort the results accordingly: -->

<br>

I will represent these data points on a map of Chicago using the
`plot_map_usage` function. In this map visualization, I will not
consider the trip count for each station (used only for setting a
minimum materiality threshold) but focus uniquely on the usage rate of
the member groups at each station:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_29.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

> Key findings:
>
> - Casual riders usage is mostly concentrated in **downtown Chicago**
>   and some **southern neighborhoods**
> - Member riders‚Äô usage is more **dispersed across the city** but
>   predominantly in the **northern** and **central regions of
>   Chicago**, suggesting a possible higher density of long-term
>   residents or commuters in these areas

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

In the next visualization, I want to focus on bike stations with a
materiality threshold **greater than 100 rides** and where the
predominance of each member group (casual or member) is **more than
70%**. Additionally, this time we will visualize the **ride count** as
the **size of the circles** on the map, providing a clear representation
of the volume of usage at each station: 

<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/img_30.png" width="80%">
</p>

<br>

> Key findings:
>

### 10.5 Most used stations (start OR end)

<br>

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Back to Summary**](#summary)

<br>

For this analysis, I aimed to investigate the **most frequently used
stations**, specifically those that are most often utilized as
**starting OR ending points** for trips. While the available data do not
provide information on the number or identity of bicycle users,
identifying the most used stations from this perspective is still
valuable. By potentially cross-referencing this data with user
information (if and when available), the accuracy of the analysis could
be enhanced.

To do this, I will aggregate the data to count how many times each
individual station was used as a starting or ending point. Therefore, if
there are $n$ total trips, the total number of observations (combined
departures and arrivals) will be $2n$:

<br>

The impression is that a **small percentage of stations** accounts for
an **extremely large portion of all departures and arrivals** for each
member group. First, let‚Äôs verify **how much** the identified **top 20**
most frequently used stations **account for** in the **total departures
and arrivals** for each member type.

<br>

    ## [1] "Top 20 stations used by CASUAL users as start OR end (~ 1%  of all Casual stations)
    account for ~ 20% of all recorded Casual departure or arrivals"

    ## [1] "Top 20 stations used by MEMBER users as start OR end (~ 1%  of all Member stations) 
    account for ~ 13% of all recorded Member departure or arrivals"

<br>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

We have **confirmed** that a **few stations** account for a **large
number of observations**. Since the company‚Äôs goal is to convert casual
riders into member riders, let‚Äôs **focus on casual riders**.

I want to understand how many departures and arrivals correspond to a
certain number of stations using a **treemap** visualization. We will
use the **top 30, 50, and 100 stations** as parameters:

> Key findings:
>
> - These results indicates that a relatively **small number of stations
>   significantly contribute to the overall volume of trips**. Few
>   stations can be considered critical nodes within the bike-sharing
>   network
> - Concentrating **advertising efforts** on these high-usage stations
>   can enhance campaign effectiveness by **reaching a larger number of
>   users**
> - Investing in **improvements** and **maintenance** at these key
>   locations can enhance the **user experience** and potentially
>   **increase service usage**
> - **Cross-referencing** these data with other user information (when
>   available) can provide a more detailed understanding of usage
>   dynamics, helping to further optimize the service
