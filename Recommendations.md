## Recommendations for the Business

Based on the key findings, here are my **top three recommendations** for
the business to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual
riders into annual members:

<br>

<span style="color: #0047AB;">📌 <strong>Recommendation 1: Targeting
casual commuters with promotional campaigns</strong></span> 🚴‍♂️📢🎟️

Among casual users, there are likely two distinct groups: **tourists**,
who are less inclined to purchase annual memberships, and **commuters**,
who might not have transitioned to membership for various reasons. Given
the anonymized dataset, it is impossible to distinguish tourists from
commuters. However, we can focus on casual commuters who represent
potential long-term members:

<br>

- **Marketing and promotional strategies**

  - **Pre-peak promotions**: highlight membership benefits before warmer
    months through targeted ads

  - **Commuter-friendly campaigns**: highlight the cost savings and
    other membership benefits in advertisements targeting casual
    commuters

  - **Priority access and reservations**: highlight the possibility to
    have priority access to bikes and reserve them in advance, ensuring
    that a bike is always available during their commute times

  <br>

- **Personalized engagement and offers**

  - **Personalized offers**: send personalized emails or app
    notifications with exclusive membership discounts to casual riders
    who show frequent weekday usage

  - **Trial memberships**: offer limited-time trial memberships to
    casual users who ride during peak commuting hours, showcasing the
    benefits and convenience of membership

<span style="color: #0047AB;">📌 <strong>Recommendation 2: Focus
advertising on high-usage stations</strong></span> 🚉🎯📈

The data indicates that a **small number of stations** contribute
significantly to the **overall volume of trips**, making these stations
critical nodes within the bike-sharing network. Concentrating
advertising efforts at these high-usage stations can effectively reach a
larger number of users, increasing engagement and interest in
memberships:

<br>

- **Strategic ads**

  - **High-visibility placement**: place prominent ads at key stations
    to promote membership benefits

  - **Localized promotions**: tailor ads to station locations,
    emphasizing commuter convenience and tourist deals

<br>

- **Engagement activities**

  - **On-site events**: host events at high-traffic stations with free
    trials and information booths

  - **Digital integration**: use geo-targeted ads and in-app
    notifications to promote memberships

<br>

<br>

<span style="color: #0047AB;">📌 <strong>Recommendation 3: Enhance user
experience with enhanced benefits and services</strong></span> 🌟📱🎁

Enhancing the overall **user experience** is crucial in making
memberships **more appealing to casual riders**. This can be achieved
through a combination enhanced membership plans, exclusive member
benefits, and improved service availability:

<br>

- **Enhanced Membership Plans**

  - **Extended free ride periods**: Introduce membership plans that
    offer extended free ride periods beyond the current 45 minutes,
    appealing to casual users who take longer trips

  - **Flexible membership options**: Offer seasonal membership plans
    that provide benefits for specific times of the year, accommodating
    riders with varying seasonal usage patterns

<br>

- **Exclusive Member Benefits**

  - **Exclusive perks**: Offer exclusive perks for members, such as
    discounts at popular destinations and events, early access to new
    bike models, or partner deals with local businesses, enhancing the
    attractiveness of membership

<br>

- **Improved service availability**

  - **Increased Bike Stations**: Expand the number of bike stations in
    high-demand areas to ensure bikes are readily available where and
    when users need them
  - **Investing in improvements and maintenance**: Regularly invest in
    improvements and maintenance to ensure bikes and stations are in
    optimal condition, providing a reliable and enjoyable riding
    experience
