## Key findings

📌 **User Composition and Ride Patterns** 🚴‍♀️

- Members account for a **larger proportion** of total rides (**65%**)
  compared to casual (**35%**)
- Members prefer more **frequent** and **short rides**, while casual
  users take longer trips

------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 **Trip Duration and Frequency** ⏱️

- Casual users collectively spend **more time on bikes** due to longer
  trip durations (average duration of **23.2 minutes**), while members
  use the service more efficiently for shorter, more frequent trips
  (average duration of **12.4 minutes**)
- **50%** of all rides last **10 minutes or less**, with casual users’
  median duration at **13.00 minutes** and members’ at **8.78 minutes**
- The vast majority of rides (**97%**) last **less than 60 minutes**
- Both groups demonstrate a significant **decline** in trip counts after
  **5 minutes** for members and **7 minutes** for casual users,
  indicating a preference for shorter travel durations

------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 **Round Trips** 🔄

- Casual users make more **round trips** (**8%**) than members (**3%**),
  indicating **leisure usage**
- Casual users’ average round trip duration is **44.24 minutes**,
  compared to members’ **23.31 minutes**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 **Trip Distance** 📏

- Approximately 99% of trips are **less than 10 km** (excluding round
  trips which have a distance of 0, otherwise it would be **95%**).
  Specifically, **60%** of rides are **up to 2 km**, and **~92%** are
  **up to 5 km**
- Both groups show a steep **decline** in trip counts **beyond 2 km**,
  reinforcing a preference for short-distance travel

------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 **Seasonal and Temporal Variations** ☀️

- Both user groups show increased activity in **warmer months**, with
  **peaks in the third quarter** and lowest ride counts in the first and
  fourth quarters
- There is a strong positive correlation with **average temperatures**,
  indicating that better weather conditions significantly boost bike
  usage
- There is a **strong positive correlation** between monthly ride counts
  and average ride duration for both user groups, suggesting that as the
  number of rides per month increases, so does the average duration of
  those rides

------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 **Weekdays vs Weekends** 📅

- Members predominantly use bikes on **weekdays** (**77%**), likely for
  commuting, while casual users have slightly more balanced usage
  between weekdays (**63%**) and weekends (**37%**)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 **Hour of Day** ⏰

- Ride counts for casual users gradually **increase throughout the
  day**, peaking around **5 PM**. Their ride counts are relatively
  steady during the late morning and early afternoon hours, indicating a
  **consistent** use pattern.
- Members show distinct **peak** in ride counts during the **morning
  commute** (7 AM to 9 AM) and the **evening commute** (4 PM to 6 PM).
  This reflects their use of the service for **work-related travel**.
  The rides count **drops** significantly during **mid-day** and **late
  evening hours**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 **Bike Preferences** 🚲

- Both groups prefer **classic bikes**, with a slightly stronger
  preference among members (**65%**) than casual users (**62%**)
- Electric bikes are used for **longer trips** and are more popular on
  **weekdays**
- Members on average **ride both types of bikes faster** than casual
  users, indicating more **efficient usage**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 **Geographic Usage** 🗺️

- Downtown Chicago, particularly the **Loop**, **Gold Coast**, **Near
  South Side**, and **Navy Pier**, sees the **highest ride counts**.
  Moderate-density areas include **Lincoln Park**, **Lakeview**, **South
  Loop**, **Logan Square**, and **Irvin Park**. Low-density areas, such
  as **Norridge** and **Summit**, have the lowest ride counts
- Casual users are **concentrated in downtown and southern
  neighborhoods**, primarily around **tourist attractions**
- Member usage is more **dispersed across the city**, with higher
  activity in **northern and central regions**, indicating regular
  commuting patterns

------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 **Popular Routes and Stations** 📍

- Casual users favor **round trips around tourist areas**, while members
  use the service for **point-to-point travel**, emphasizing commuting
  and daily activities
- **A small number of stations** significantly contribute to overall
  ride volume, especially for casual users
